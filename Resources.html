								<h3>Trekkinâ€™ Tech: The Traveling Lab Tech Page (Facebook)</h3>
								<p>The page is geared towards the traveling medical technologist. There is a great community of techs who collaborate and provide valuable information. India, one of the admins, created a google docs containing reviews on facilities, recruiters, pay, housing and state licensure. </p>
								
								<h3>Travel Evolved Podcast</h3>
								<p>Mark Holloway provides great content via weekly podcasts on the travel healthcare industry. He goes in depth on various topics pulling from his 21 years of experience in the field.</p>
								
								<h3>Furnished Finder</h3>
								<p>The website focuses on short term housing for the traveling healthcare professional. One of the housing websites to check when looking for a place to stay for your assignment.</p>
								
								<h3>AirBnB</h3>
								<p>Popular for vacation travel, Airbnb is also used to find short term housing for travel assignments. </p>

								<h3>Facebook Marketplace Rentals</h3>
								<p>In my first assignment, both Furnished Finder and Airbnb did not have any available housing. Scrambling around, I took to Facebook marketplace.I fortunately found a furnished place and negotiated a 6 month rental. 3 month assignments may be harder to do, but the FB marketplace is worth a look.</p>

								<h3>Fusion Marketplace</h3>
								<p>You can search for assignments on Fusion Market place. This gives you the ability to view and compare rates for future contracts against your current agency prices. </p>

								<h3>Travel Tax</h3>
								<p>Taxes can get complicated for us travel healthcare professionals. I personally have not used their services but it seems some in the FB tech group have. The president of the company was a former travel Respiratory Therapist who then received his masters and bachelors in accounting. He also carries an EA credential (Enrolled Agent). This is the highest credential the IRS awards for those who pass the three part exam. I plan on scheduling a tax home consultancy and will report back with any new information I learn. </p>
